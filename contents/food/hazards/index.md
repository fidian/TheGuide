All food is harboring botulinum cells, which cause [Botulism](botulism.html), will produce gases and this pressure will cause jars to lose their seal, have lids bulge, and cans may seem inflated.  The food may also have a foul odor.  All preserved food should have a good vacuum and should be immediately discarded if there are any signs of spoilage.  Do not reuse the jars because touching the spoiled food or breathing the air may infect you.
