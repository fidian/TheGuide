Following the practices in this guide will ensure foods are safe when stored below 95° F / 35° C.  Canned foods should be stored between 50° to 70° F / 10° to 21° C for a longer shelf life and better quality of foods.

Canning with a pressure canner is required for foods that are not acidic enough ([pH](../../terminology/ph.html) > 4.6) because the foods should reach a canning temperature of 250° F / 121° C.  With foods that are more acidic, such as apples and tomatoes, one can use the lower canning temperature of 212° F / 100° C.  Also, if you are canning foods at a higher altitude, you might be required to use a pressure canner because water will boil at a lower temperature.

It is important that you choose fresh, undamaged foods when canning.  Discard foods with any signs of spoilage, diseases or mold.  Fruits and vegetables should be canned within 12 hours, but can be kept in a cool place for a couple days before canning.  Some foods, like peaches, apricots, pears, nectarines and plums should be allowed to ripen for 1 day before canning.  Meats should be chilled and canned right away.  Fish and seafoods should be iced after harvest and canned within 2 days.


Hot Pack vs. Raw Pack
=====================

The USDA recommends that one uses a hot pack method while canning because it is the best way to remove air from the foods and is the preferred way to can using a boiling water canner.  Hot pack is where you have the food you want to can simmering in liquid for 2 to 3 minutes.  You pour the food and the liquid into a sterilized jar, then finish the canning procedure.  Raw pack is where the food is crammed into the jar first and then boiling water is paced into the jar.  One should then raise the temperature of the canned foods up to boiling again and finish the canning procedure.  Raw packing is more suitable for use in a pressure canner.

Headspace
=========

You want to leave a gap between the lid and the top of the liquid so that you can form a good vacuum and to allow for the expansion of the food during processing. Jellies and jams should have ¼ inch / 6 mm, ½ inch / 13 mm for fruits and tomatoes that are processed in boiling water, and 1 to 1¼ inches / 25 to 30 mm for low-acid foods processed in a pressure caner.
