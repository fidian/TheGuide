What is a FAQ?
==============

FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions.  It's the first place you should go if you have a question.  Most people happen to have the same sort of questions regarding a topic and the FAQ probably already has a pretty good answer for you.


Why is The Guide geared for an eBook?
=====================================

Among the survival / self-sufficient crowd, there is a strong push to always get the paper copy of information.  I can completely understand this, especially if you no longer have power or technology around.  Even though there's a good argument to write this as an actual book, here's my reasons that I chose to make a website instead.

* Books weight a lot and take up a lot of space.  I could add a hundreds of books and hundreds of reference images and that only increases the download size.  Your eBook reader probably will still work like a charm and easily hold all the information.  Alternately, you coupld print out thousands of pieces of paper and keep binders of everything.  Maybe you'd want to select to take only portions with you; which ones do you think are not important now, but you might need next week?

* Books don't get updated well.  If new information is useful, I would want to be able to include it in The Guide and have everyone get an updated version quickly.  Printed copies do not get automatically updated; one usually ends up holding on to an old revision instead of getting the latest and greatest.

* Books are being phased out.  Newspapers are starting to close up shops and publishers are putting out fewer and fewer physical books each year.

* Information is good, but linked information is much better.  I could have an article on survival in arctic climates and wish to direct the reader to a specific food preservation technique.  With books, such associations are done with "see page 27" and with eBooks we just make a link.

* A specific downside of using an electronic medium is that we need a computer and power to read it.  Luckily, this could be a cell phone, eReader, tablet, laptop or any other device.  There's even solar powered eBook readers and cases for your reader to let it charge with just the light in the room.  You can extend the life of your reader indefinately.  See [LG Display]'s device, Toshiba's [Biblio Leaf] or even peek into the future with a [flexible e-reader] that is also solar powered.  You can also modify your own eReader ([instructables], [lifehacker]), buy a [solar case] or just get a solar powered battery that has the right USB hookup to charge your device.

Why should I bother when this guide has so little content?
==========================================================

This is a project that I have wanted to tackle for many years.  My goal is to just create something useful for everyone that they can use in an emergency.  I do not intend to get it all written in a weekend.  The plan is to build this slowly over several years.  After I get lots and lots of content into the guide, you will hopefully agree that the contents of this site all packed into a little device would be far more convenient than having the same knowledge in printed books.

Plus, you can always [contribute content](contact.html) to make The Guide even better.
