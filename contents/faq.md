What is a FAQ?
==============

FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions.  It's the first place you should go if you have a question.  Most people happen to have the same sort of questions regarding a topic and the FAQ probably already has a pretty good answer for you.


Why is The Guide geared for an eBook?
=====================================

Among the survival / self-sufficient crowd, there is a strong push to always get the paper copy of information.  I can completely understand this, especially if you no longer have power or technology around.  Even though there's a good argument to write this as an actual book, here's my reasons that I chose to make a website instead.

* Books are being phased out.  Newspapers are starting to close up shops and publishers are putting out fewer and fewer physical books each year.

* Books don't get updated well.  If new information is useful, I would want to be able to include it in The Guide and have everyone get an updated version quickly.  Paper isn't updated as readily.

* It is easier to write several little articles and connect them all together than it is to write one coherent tome of knowledge.  Many of the survival books out there try to avoid the unconnected articles, but the ones I find the most useful are the ones that treat each subject as a separate entity.  Websites like the Wikipedia offer huge amounts of information and then cross-link it to other topics that may be useful, saving you from trying to find some sort of index in a book and then flip to another page to see if that's discussing the topic you need.

* eBook readers are coming out that are solar powered, meaning that I can put thousands of pages into this site and it will all fit on a device the size of a small first-aid kit.  Adding another hundred pages never increases the weight nor volume of the reader; you will never need to decide if you will take all of the information or if some of the "less essential" things needs to be left behind.  One just needs a way to charge your eBook.  See [LG Display]'s device, Toshiba's [Biblio Leaf] or even peek into the future with a [flexible e-reader] that is also solar powered.  You can also modify your own eReader ([instructables], [lifehacker]) or just get a solar powered battery that has the right USB hookup to charge your device.

Why should I bother when this guide has so little content?
==========================================================

This is a project that I have wanted to tackle for many years.  My goal is to just create something useful for everyone that they can use in an emergency.  I do not intend to get it all written in a weekend.  The plan is to build this slowly over several years.  After I get lots and lots of content into the guide, you will hopefully agree that the contents of this site all packed into a little device would be far more convenient than having the same knowledge in printed books.

Plus, you can always [contribute content](contact.html) to make The Guide even better.
