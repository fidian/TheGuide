title: Temperature from Crickets
template: index.jade
---

The chirps from crickets speed up with warmer weather and slow down when it is colder.  From this variation, one can get a fairly good estimation of the temperature outside by listening to these insects.


Easy
====

The simplest method of getting a ballpark temperature from counting cricket chirps is count the number of chirps in 15 seconds and add 37.  You will then find the approximate temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.  For Celsius, count the chirps in 25 seconds, add 8, then divide by 3.

    째F = (chirps in 15 seconds) + 37

         (chirps in 25 seconds) + 8
    째C = --------------------------
                     3

More Accurate
=============

A. E. Dolbear did more studies to refine the formula and the Bessey brothers did even more refinements.  The updated, and more complex method of determining a slightly more accurate number is to use the formula below.

              (chirps in 1 minute) - 92
    째F = 60 + -------------------------
                        4.7

         140   (chirps in 1 minute) - 92
    째C = --- + -------------------------
          9              8.46
