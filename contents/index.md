The Guide
=========

The Self Reliant Guide is a project to create a free reference to help humans survive whatever disasters that could happen.  The content is entirely free for others to use or to copy to their own devices.  Why not a paper copy?  Please see the [FAQ] for the answer to this question and many others.

Topics Covered
==============

Anything that could help out in a disaster would be useful.  Information contained in The Guide should help out with threats that have a larger chance of happening, such as being lost, withstanding power outages, how to handle riots, and surviving natural disasters.  These pages may also help out in the unlikely event of alien attacks, financial collapse, pandemic diseases, zombie apocalypse or merely being stranded after a bizarre skiing accident.  Handling obscure disasters has a lot of overlap with handling the more common ones, plus it might be more fun to think about how you'd overcome vampires instead of tackling a building fire caused by a meth lab down the street.

One key aspect is that every article must list its sources.  It's always good to know the information presented is accurate and is based on legitimate publications, so that is why the sources for the information is always listed on each page.  Perhaps you'll be intrigued by some subject and this could be a good pointer for where you can obtain additional knowledge.
