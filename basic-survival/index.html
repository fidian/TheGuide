<ul>
<li><a href="/basic-survival/shelter/">Shelter</a> - If you are exposed to the elements, you might not last the night.</li>
<li><a href="/basic-survival/water/">Water</a> - Everyone needs water to survive.  While you are working and exerting yourself in a survival situation, you use up lots more water.</li>
<li><a href="/basic-survival/fire/">Fire</a> - This is one of the most basic and most useful elements.  With it you can purify water, cook food, stay warm, and it may also scare off animals.</li>
<li>Food - You&#39;ll burn lots of calories while trying to build your shelter, obtain food and water, and while creating fire.  Food is how you replace these calories.</li>
<li>Hope - A positive attitude and keeping a particular goal in mind will help you not slip into despair and depression.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Rule of Threes</h1>
<p>The &quot;Rule of Threes&quot; may not be entirely accurate, but it does give you pretty good estimates and reasoning for what needs to take priority when you are forced into a situation where you must survive.</p>
<h2>You can survive 3 seconds without your mind</h2>
<p>In an emergency, time is of the essence.  You have perhaps three seconds to decide if you are going to escape or what immediate action you will take.  For instance, if you were in a plane crash, you have approximately 90 seconds to get out.  The best way to keep your mind is with training or exposure to emergency situations.</p>
<h2>You can survive 3 minutes without air</h2>
<p>I&#39;m not quite able to hold my breath that long, but you get the idea.  Without air to breathe, you die.  There&#39;s not a lot of preparation you can do to combat this beyond exercising and being more athletically fit.</p>
<h2>You can survive 3 hours without shelter</h2>
<p>Even if you are only trying to survive a chilly 50° F / 10° C night, you could die of hypothermia unless you have adequate shelter.</p>
<h2>You can survive 3 days without water</h2>
<p>This assumes you&#39;re comfortable in your house and not doing anything.  When you are lost in a desert or trying to make your way across snow-filled terrain, you may not even make it this long.</p>
<h2>You can survive 3 weeks without food</h2>
<p>Really, you will weaken far before three weeks and you will be consuming lots of calories when you build shelter, find water, and perform whatever activities you need to do in order to obtain food.</p>
<h2>You can survive 3 months without hope or purpose</h2>
<p>Some survival shows will strand an expert in the wilderness and film the next couple days.  This expert has a goal:  survive for a couple days.  They don&#39;t go into the long term effects of being alone.  You need a sense of purpose and most people require some form of companionship.</p>
