With one, you are better prepared to handle many different types of encounters.  This goes by many names, but the concept is almost always the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>People in rough terrain have a <em>get home bag</em>.</li>
<li>Kids that might leave home often keep a <em>runaway bag</em>.</li>
<li>Survivalists call theirs a <em>bug-out bag</em>.</li>
<li>First responders keep a <em>go bag</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Why Keep One?</h1>
<p>Having the basics around in case of emergency means that you&#39;ve thought about different problems and how you would overcome them.  Keeping a kit nearby might mean the difference between life and death or maybe just would make you more comfortable.  The idea is that if you can grab this kit then your odds of getting to a safer location or better position are greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>This kit could help you in the following ways, just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>You had a coffee accident at work and you need a fresh change of clothes.</li>
<li>Your car broke down and you needed to take a lengthy hike into town on a hot day and also pay for your car to get towed.</li>
<li>An earthquake or fire makes your home unlivable.</li>
<li>You are mugged and your phone, identification and valuables are stolen.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How Big Are They?</h1>
<p>You can keep one in the trunk of your car, under the bed or maybe in the garage.  It should be easily accessible in case of imminent danger.  I would recommend keeping track of your supplies in three locations:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your person.</li>
<li>Always nearby, such as in a backpack or purse.</li>
<li>In a safe location, such as in your vehicle or home.</li>
</ol>
<p>What you keep on you at all times should help you get to your backpack/purse.  What you keep there should provide what you need to get to your larger pack in the car or at home.</p>
<h1>What Goes In?</h1>
<p>First, a couple guiding principles.</p>
<ol>
<li>It should be light enough to carry easily.</li>
<li>It should last you long enough to get somewhere safer.</li>
<li>Everyone should have their own bag.</li>
<li>Use it and keep it up to date.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, you should consider the following topics and pack accordingly.  Remember to try to keep the size down, so consider things that can perform &quot;double duty&quot; and are useful in a broad range of scenarios.</p>
<h2>First Aid</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Prescription medicines.  If you are on medicines, you should keep extra doses nearby in case you can&#39;t get home.</p>
</li>
<li><p>First Aid kit.  Depending on the space available, this could range from a couple bandages and ibuprofen to a full-blown family-sized medical kit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>First Aid instructions.  A quick-reference for emergencies can help when your mind blanks, or could give another person the needed information to help you out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Razor blade.  A single edge razor blade wrapped in cardboard can make much cleaner cuts than the other knifes you&#39;d carry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Paperwork</h2>
<p>Keep these things sealed in a waterproof container such as a freezer bag or vacuum sealed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Notarized or official copies of birth certificates, social security cards, drivers&#39; licenses, other vital paperwork.  These can greatly speed progress through government systems in case of a disaster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cash.  In case of financial crisis or to purchase supplies, money is often handy and it&#39;s easy to pack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact information.  Print out a copy of your address book so you can still call or write to people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spare paper and writing utensil.  This can be especially useful for leaving messages or even starting fires.  Many people cut down a normal pen or pencil.  Others use special water-resistant paper and waterproof ink or permanent markers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bank cards and credit cards.  Having a copy of the card numbers, account numbers, CVV and the banks&#39; phone numbers means you can cancel them when stolen or still use them online if you left them at home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Food and Water</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>High calorie food.  One can purchase life raft survival bars that won&#39;t fill you up but will provide necessary calories.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Water.  The FDA says bottled water has no expiration date, so keep some ready.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Water purification / filtration system.  It is highly unlikely you would like to carry around 72 hours worth of water.  Turn any water you find into usable water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drink mixes.  Try to get individual packets of &quot;sport&quot; drink mix so it replenishes electrolytes.  If nothing else, consider adding a pinch of salt (an electrolyte) to drinking water.  You need to replenish what gets lost through sweat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Knife.  A pocket knife on your person, a multi-tool in your pack and a survival knife / machete.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Saw.  A multi-tool might have a saw, but you may prefer a folding saw or a wire saw.  Give your saw a try and see how well it performs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Duct tape.  Get a tiny roll and smash it flat or make your own roll by wrapping several feet of tape around an old credit card.  Can protect the user from blisters and patch leaks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Light source.  Flashlights and headlamps are quick but need batteries.  Glow sticks work for hours but aren&#39;t too bright and can freeze.  Candles shed light and a tiny amount of heat but need a source of fire and are sensitive to wind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lighter or matches.  I&#39;d suggest getting a mini lighter because it&#39;s reusable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Communications radio.  A FRS/GMRS radio is inexpensive and can travel miles.  A good pocket radio will pull in news broadcasts and NOAA weather reports.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigation.  Paper or waterproof maps and a compass.  A GPS can be useful but you need batteries and it should have maps in the device.  Sexton, if you know how to use one.</p>
</li>
<li><p>550 paracord.  Super strong rope that can be separated into individual strands.  With work, this can take the place of fishing line, dental floss, sewing thread and possibly tinder for starting fires.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hygiene and Personal Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Spare set of clothes.  Make sure they work for the climate you are in!  Imagine sleeping in them at night and hiking in the sun during the day.  This should be a full set of clothes, from underwear to shoes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sewing needle.  Make sure your floss fits.  Great for sutures and wardrobe malfunctions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Other Ideas</h1>
<p>This section is just to give you ideas.  Remember that the kit should work for you in your area.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol.  You can start fires and clean wounds.</li>
<li>Aluminum foil.  Heavy duty foil can become a water carrying container or a signal mirror.</li>
<li>Clean towel or cloth.  Useful as headgear, for bathing, filtering water.</li>
<li>Cooking tools.  Folding stove with canned fuel or heat tablets.  Silverware or spork.  Pot, bowl, cup or any container that can be heated.</li>
<li>Dental floss.  To save space, wrap the floss around something else and discard the container.</li>
<li>Durable gloves.</li>
<li>Ear plugs.</li>
<li>Extra keys.  Not just your home, but maybe family and trusted friends.</li>
<li>Fishhook and tackle.  Fish gobble up nearly anything, such as gum wrappers and aluminum foil.</li>
<li>Flares.</li>
<li>Flash drive.  A jump drive can be loaded up with many personal documents and lists, plus they can be much smaller than paper.</li>
<li>Glasses and sunglasses.  Do you wear corrective lenses or have prescription eyeglasses?  What about the sun&#39;s reflection from snow and water?</li>
<li>Handgun.  Careful and respect local laws.  If you do decide to pack this, consider extra ammo and the sheer weight that&#39;s being added.</li>
<li>Hat.  A cloth hat or similar headgear to keep the sun off you during the summer.</li>
<li>Large plastic sheet.  This can quickly become an improvised shelter.</li>
<li>Mini shovel.</li>
<li>Monocular or binoculars.</li>
<li>Plastic bags.  Collapsible containers that could hold water or keep it out.</li>
<li>Pre-paid calling cards.</li>
<li>Rain gear.  Poncho or a large garbage bag.</li>
<li>Reference books.  The &quot;Pocket Ref&quot; has almost every reference table in it.  Army survival guide, plant identification quick reference or other useful book.</li>
<li>Safety pins.</li>
<li>Sharpening stone.</li>
<li>Signal mirror or reflective patches.</li>
<li>Signal whistle.</li>
<li>Sleeping gear.  This would include bedrolls, sleeping bags, pads, survival blankets / survival sleeping bags.</li>
<li>Soap.</li>
<li>Spare batteries.  What sizes do you use?  How long would they last?  Can you charge your cell phone?</li>
<li>Sunscreen.</li>
<li>Super glue.  This can also be used as emergency sutures.</li>
<li>Toilet paper.  Sometimes it&#39;s nice to just have around.  Can double as gauze.</li>
<li>Wire.  It&#39;s like fireproof rope that you can shape.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What to Avoid</h1>
<p>This is not a list of things that absolutely <strong>must not</strong> be packed.  Instead, it is guidelines that may or may not apply to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider skipping flint and steel, a bar of magnesium, Swedish FireSteel, a fire piston, magnifying lens or other ways of making fire.  Matches and lighters are small and work quite well.  Most people have trouble with these other methods.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Keeping Up To Date</h1>
<p>The climate outside changes.  If it is hotter, consider packing more water.  If you start getting to sub-zero temperatures, you&#39;ll probably switch to warmer clothes.</p>
<p>Your first aid kit will expire eventually, typically 3-5 years from the manufacture date.</p>
<p>The FDA has determined that there is no limit to the shelf life of bottled water.  Purchasing the right foods and keeping them in a cool, dry location will let them last for many years.</p>
